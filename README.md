# instagram-emails-generation-validation

You own an e-commerce business and would like to generate new leads and future clients. 

You buy ads placement on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat or Youtube... 

It costs up to 20-25 % of the total price of an average product but worked especially to attract the first customers.

Then when you look closely at the analytics. Maybe you generate 80 % of the revenue through email marketing (as I did for a client). 

The emails shows new products, new affiliates, new collaborations, fresh blog content and thus drives traffic + sales.

"We need more emails !"

It is the goal of the scripts I uploaded here. 


Be responsible : The service-product has to be tailored to PROFESSIONAL people to comply with RGPD rules in vigor accross E.U. In this sense, a file containing names and                          surnames has to be declared.
                 A high number of emails become useful with a high delivery rate in the box. Thus I am patient and send 30-50 emails per day automatically with 1 domain 
                 or multiple domains and higher sent/day. If you need any help to set-it up, feel free to send me messages. I have no idea about how to deal with firewalls or    CDN, that's why I use rotating proxy and parallel scripts, it uses to work sometimes.
