# instagram-emails-generation-validation

You own an e-commerce business and would like to generate new leads and future clients. 

You buy ads placement on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat or Youtube... 

It costs up to 20-25 % of the total price of an average product but worked especially to attract the first customers just by spending some money ! 

Then when you look closely at the analytics. Maybe you generate 80 % of the revenue through email marketing as I did for a client. 

The emails shows new products, new affiliates, new collaborations, fresh blog content and thus drives traffic + sales.

"We need more emails !!!"

It is the goal of the scripts I uploaded here. 


Beware : The service-product has to be tailored to PROFESSIONAL people to comply with RGPD rules in vigor accross E.U. In this sense, a file containing names and surnames 
         has to be declared.
         A high number of emails become useful with a high delivery rate in the box. Thus I am patient and send 30-50 emails per day automatically with 1 domain 
         or - more with strategy.
