# Instagram-emails-generation-validation

Maybe you or someone you know owns an e-commerce business and would like to generate new leads and future clients. 

Maybe you or someone you know buys ads placement on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat or Youtube... 

It costs up to 20-25 % of the total price of an average product and works well to attract the first customers.

Then when you look closely at the analytics. Maybe you generate 80 % of the revenue through email marketing (as I did for a client). 

The emails shows new products, new affiliates, new collaborations, fresh blog content and thus drives traffic + sales.

"We need more emails !"

It is the goal of the scripts I uploaded here. 


N.B : The service-product shoudl be adressed to PROFESSIONAL people inside company to comply with RGPD rules accross E.U. Indeed, the file containing names and                          surnames has to be declared as well as "generated and validated" email adresses.
                 A high number of emails become useful with a high delivery rate in the box. Thus I am patient and send 30-50 emails per day automatically with 1 domain 
                 or multiple domains and higher sent/day. If you need any help to set-it up, feel free to send me messages. 
                 
**What is the point ? **

Generate emails adresses with generic email providers from name and surname scrapped on social media and validate them in batch on a third party website.
